# Data Security

* All the data on a server is in the form of files and directories.
* A file is an end object.
* A directory is a container.
* On a single server there can multiple user accounts.
* There can be a lot of data on a server belonging to various users & groups.
* In order to control access of data for users and groups we must define data security.
* file & directory permissions are set to archieve data security.
* Since file and directory are 2 different type of object, the concept a bit permission is different for both.
