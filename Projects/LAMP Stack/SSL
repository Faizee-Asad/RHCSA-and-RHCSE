🔐 SSL Deployment on EC2 (Amazon Linux + Apache + PHP)

✅ Prerequisites:

EC2 instance is running

Your blog is accessible on HTTP (http://your-ip)

You own a domain (e.g., yourdomain.com)

Your domain is pointed to your EC2 public IP (via DNS A record)

Example A record:

Type: A
Name: yourdomain.com
Value: 13.201.33.185
TTL: 300
Once the domain is working with HTTP, proceed.

🛠 Step 1: Install Certbot (for Amazon Linux 2023)

sudo dnf install -y epel-release
sudo dnf install -y certbot python3-certbot-apache mod_ssl

🛠 Step 2: Request and Install SSL Certificate

sudo certbot --apache

You'll be asked:

Enter your domain name: yourdomain.com

Choose to redirect HTTP to HTTPS (recommended)

Certbot will:

Automatically configure Apache

Add SSL certificates

Reload the Apache service

✅ Now visit:
https://yourdomain.com

🔁 Step 3: Auto-Renew SSL (Recommended)
Let’s Encrypt certs expire every 90 days. Add this cron job to auto-renew:

echo "0 2 * * * root /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet" | sudo tee /etc/cron.d/certbot-renew

🎉 Done! Your blog now runs on HTTPS.

✅ Bonus (Force HTTPS via .htaccess if needed)
In /var/www/html/.htaccess:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
