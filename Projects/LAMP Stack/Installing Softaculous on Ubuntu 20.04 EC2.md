# 📝 Step-by-Step Guide to Install Softaculous (via Webuzo)

Softaculous requires a control panel to manage its features. On a raw Ubuntu EC2, the easiest is to use Webuzo, which is made by the same team.

## ✅ Step 1: Launch an Ubuntu 20.04 EC2 Instance

Select Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM), 64-bit
Allow ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS)
Choose t2.micro (for testing), with at least 20GB disk

## ✅ Step 2: Connect via SSH
```
ssh -i SSH-KEY.pem ubuntu@<your-ec2-ip>
```

## ✅ Step 3: Download and Install Webuzo
```
wget -N http://files.webuzo.com/install.sh
chmod 0755 install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
🕐 This may take 15–30 minutes.

## ✅ Step 4: Access Webuzo Panel
```
http://<your-ec2-ip>:2004
```
You’ll be prompted to set up:
Admin username/password
Domain (you can use EC2 IP)
App stack (LAMP recommended)

## ✅ Step 5: Install Apps with Softaculous

Inside the Webuzo panel:
Go to Enduser Panel
Navigate to Softaculous
Browse or search for apps (e.g., WordPress, Laravel)
Click Install and set options (domain, DB name, admin login)
